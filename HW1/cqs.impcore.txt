1) if (3 > 5){
       return 17
   else{
       return 99
   } 
   the value of this function is 99

2) b) A definition can be made with any
      expression as one of its parts

3) No, there are too many arguments
   for a + operation

4) a) x = 9 - (12 /  3);
   b) (set x (- 9 (/ 12 3)))

5) a) Binary, decimal and parity are
      all other choices for n's stucture
   b) By inputing test n's we can determine
      by seeing what m's were used in it's 
      creation

6) a) factorial is a self explatory  name
      as it is obious how such a function
      would be used and only has one var
      which is the number being factorialed
   b) for the power fucntion there are two
      variables used, one for the number and
      one for the power. As such a contract 
      is nessisary to show which is which,
      as it is not obious which number 
      should be passed
