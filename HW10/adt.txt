Abstraction
BIGNUM

Operation
ofInt, negated, +, - ,*, sdiv, comp, tostring

representation
tuple of (bool, natrual)

invariant
(bool = false(negative), natrual = 0)

Abstract Function

A(b,n) = n -> (int) n * (if b then 1 else -1)


Abstraction
natural

Operation
ofInt, +, -, *, sdiv, compare, decimal, invariant

representation
the same data structure found in previous ml assignment. That being
natural n  = (int, natural)

invariant
n cannot be negative, n cannot have leading zeros, n must be of type natural.


Abstract Function
A(b,n) = n -> (int) n * (if b then 1 else -1)
