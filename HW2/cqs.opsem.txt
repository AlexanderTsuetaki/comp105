or questions 1--7, please read pages 28--37 (the book sections on
environments and on operational semantics of expressions).
These questions are multiple-choice.

 1. $\xi$ is an environment that maps names to

    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

 2. $\phi$ is an environment that maps names to

    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.

 3. $\rho$ is an environment that maps names to

    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.

 4. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $e$ stand for?

    (d) an expression

 5. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $v$ stand for?

    (e) a value

 6. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase $\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}(x)$ stand for?

    (e) a value (outputs 7)

 7. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase $\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}\{x \mapsto 8\}$ stand for?

    (b) an Impcore variable

Questions 8 and 9 are also based on
pages 28--37.
Please answer a number.

 8. How many rules have the IF syntactic form in the conclusion?

    2 rules: true, false

 9. How many rules have the APPLY syntactic form in the conclusion?
    (Look at all the rules in the section, not just the
    summary on page 80.)

    6 rules: 3 userdef, primitive, print, artihmatics, function of v & w
               and overflow

Now let's understand a subtle point about rules. Study the FormalVar
and FormalAssign rules starting on page 32.  In FormalVar, the initial
and final states have the same $\rho$.  But in the FormalAssign rule,
there is an initial state with $\rho$, an intermediate state with
$\rho'$, and a final state with $\rho'\{x \mapsto v\}$.  Answer these
questions:

10. In rule FormalVar, the initial and final state have the same $\rho$ because

    (c) Evaluating $x$ doesn't change the value of any formal parameter.

11. In rule FormalAssign, there is an intermediate state with $\rho'$
    (rho-prime) because

    (a) Evaluating $e$ might change the value of some formal parameter.

12. Consider the sample derivation on page 58.
The same $\rho$ is used throughout the derivation because

    (a) Every subexpression is known, and because there is no unknown
        subexpression, there is no need for a $\rho'$ (rho-prime).
