q 10 is not solved. I am still getting ERRORS
to find q10 search (***************NEW WORK Q 10*************)
it is commented out since i could not figure out what how to fix it.
I understand the basic idea of how to do the question, type matching with the
correct each type of expression, I am however getting errors when trying to
access the expressions componenets.


for question 4 I would think that adding this improvement does little if
anything at all since removing the free vars is in the same O time as the
program itself meaning that searching through it shouldn't improve preformance

I burned my hand today and was thus not able to submit on time sorry.

I recieved some help from the ta's yesterday, but did not collaborate with anyone
