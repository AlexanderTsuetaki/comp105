Completed: everything except q19 is broken and qR is on the right track but
broken.  IMPORTANT: qR is completely commented out, but is on line 2555

TA's we collaborated with:
Timothy, Ben, Matt, Lulu, Josefine, Viet, Skye, Emily


Answer to question R:
a) * -> *
b) ref has type  FORALL (["'a"], FUNTY ([tvA], reftype tvA)))
   ! has type    FORALL (["'a"], FUNTY ([reftype tvA], tvA))
   := has type   FORALL (["'a"], FUNTY ([reftype tvA, tvA], unittype))

Description of design and implementation:

We followed the directions as indicated on the spec. We created the typedof
function one part at a time, and skipped to different locations as the spec
said to.  Most of these inside functions are powered by let, since we needed
to define more variables and functions inside.
