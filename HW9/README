Bignums was tested first with tests inside bignum.smt. We tested the functions
as follows using check-print:

tested if fromsmall works for 0 (num < base) and (num > base)
tested comparison work for > < and = for combinations of 0 and (num > base)
tested arithmetic for combinations of 0 and (num > base)

Natural was tested first with tests inside bignum.smt. We tested the functions

tested if fromsmall works for 0, negative numbers and positive numbers
tested comparison work for > < and = for combinations of
0, negative numbers and positive numbers
